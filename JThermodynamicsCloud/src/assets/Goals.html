	With the advent of the explosion of data produced within a project and with the increasing pressure to have an
	efficient means to communicate and disseminate this data, the role of a well-defined data management plan within a
	proposal is expanding and the requirement becoming mandatory.
	An essential part of a data management plan is a sustainable and manageable repository of data.
	CHEMCONNECT and its fundamental principles and extensive knowledge base represents the next generation of data
	repositories. Data files are not just stored. The data within those files are interpreted and put into the context
	of the extensive domain knowledge. CHEMCONNECT provides the framework for extensive documentation of the entire
	scientific process from thorough descriptions of the measurement devices (including subystems, components and
	sensors), documentation of the methodologies, from calibration to measurement to manipulation to final results, and
	research protocols linking together all aspects of the scientific process.
	The goal of CHEMCONNECT is the be the tool at the center of the research ecosystem and to promote FAIR of Findable,
	Accessable, Interoperable and Reusable data. The further goal of CHEMCONNECT is to provide the framework of
	experimental documentation, with protocols, methodologies and device descriptions, for Transparency and Openness
	Promotion (TOP) trend in scientific publishing.
	A further goal of CHEMCONNECT is to provide a natural framework for data entry. The framework is meant to adapt to
	the researcher needs. CHEMCONNECT should accept data, including units and formats, as the researcher naturally
	presents them. The extensive knowledge base of CHEMCONNECT plays an essential role in achieving this.
