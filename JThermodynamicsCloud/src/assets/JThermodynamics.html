	JThermodynamics (originally a JAVA implementation of THERGAS, formally called JTHERGAS) estimates temperature
	dependent thermodynamic information from two dimensional graphical representations of molecules and radicals based
	on the Benson additivity method. The main use of this method is within automatic combustion mechanism generation
	systems where fast estimation of a large number and variety of chemical species is needed.
	The implementation calculates thermodynamics of radical based on three different techniques, THERGAS, Benson Radical
	Rules and THERM. These methods differ primarily on how they calculate radical species. The temperature dependent
	thermodynamics of the parent molecule are calculated in the same way. The symmetry of the molecule and radicals are
	determined by JThermodynamics based on the methods and data of THERGAS and Benson's book.
	The implementation strategy, which differs from other lewis structure (2-D-graphical) thermodynamic estimators such
	as THERM and THERGAS, is based on meta-atom definitions and substructure analysis allowing a highly extensible
	database without modification of the core algorithms. Several interfaces for the database and the calculations are
	provided from terminal line commands, to graphical interfaces to web-services. The first order estimation of
	thermodynamics is based summing up the contributions of each heavy atom bonding description. Second order
	corrections due to steric hindrance and ring strain are made. Automatic estimate of contributions due to internal,
	external and optical symmetries are also made. Radicals are calculated by taking the difference due to the lost of
	hydrogen radicals taking into account changes in symmetry, spin, rotations, vibrations and steric hindrances.
