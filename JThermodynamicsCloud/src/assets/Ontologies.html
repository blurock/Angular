	An essential element of CHEMCONECT is the interaction with an ontology, a software technical machine-interpretable representation of knowledge. 
	An ontology can provide meta-data for software and knowledge concepts within a software system.
	In CHEMCONNECT the ontology is used on many levels:
	<ul>
	<li>Chemical Knowledge: All chemical knowledge represented by the database is defined within the ontology. This provides
	definitions of concept and their relationships to other chemical concept and places them in a hierarchy
	of understanding.
	<li> Data Structures: All data structures, both for the chemical data representations and for the software structures
	needed to manage the database, are defined through ontologies.
	<li> GUI: The GUI software is driven by the definitions given by the ontology, such as human readable interpretation of 
	concepts through labels and comments, menu structures providing choices, and meta information about the data objects being
	displayed through the GUI.
	<li> Database Structures: All objects and knowledge in the databases are represented by ontologies. This not only gives meta
	information about the objects within database objects, but also gives relationships between the database objects.
	<li>Ontology Driven: CHEMCONNECT is designed to be as general as possible and relies on the ontology for the 
	domain specific applications. All aspects of the software design relies on ontology definitions.
	</ul>
