	Edward S. Blurock has over 35 years of experience, both in chemical data and modelling which is the core of this
	project (for example, REACTION (1) and JTHERGAS (2)), and in applied artificial intelligence and machine learning
	techniques and software (at the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation, Austria (3) and Combustion Physics,
	Sweden (4)). Currently, he is recognized to be at the forefront of data management within the community by being the
	‘Standard definition for data collection and mining toward a virtual chemistry of Smart Energy Carriers‘ Working
	Group leader in COST Action network CM1404, ‘Chemistry of Smart Energy Carriers and Technologies’(5), and leader of
	the CM1401 task to catalog data use within the community. He is co-editor and co-author of several chapters in the
	book Cleaner Combustion: Developing Detailed Chemical Kinetic Models.
