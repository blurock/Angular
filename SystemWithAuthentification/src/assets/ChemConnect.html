	ChemConnect is a smart cloud-based repository of experimental, theoretical and computational data. ChemConnect goes
	beyond traditional data repositories in that the data is parsed and analysed with respect to an extensive chemical
	and combustion knowledge base. The parsed data is then linked allowing for efficient searching and comparison of
	combustion data. The goal is to have all data associated with experiments, from a device description, to the
	intermediate data (both computed and measured) and to their associated interpretations and the procedures and
	methodologies to the final published results and references to be available. Having published data linked to its
	dependent measurements and constants, devices, subsystems, sensors and even people and laboratories provides an
	effective accountability and more confidence in the data. Data entry and availability can range from private user,
	to user defined consortia to general public.
