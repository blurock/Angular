One of the goals of CHEMCONNECT and JThermodynamics is to promote transparency and reproducability through 
its management of data. The Tranparency and Openness Commitee (TOP) met in November 2014 to set guidelines 
on how to promote openness and scientific communications. Some of the top guidelines promoted by CHEMCONNECT
and JThermodynamics is:
<ul>
<li> Citations: Connected with each data object upon input into the system is the possibility of a 
bibliographic reference to its source.
<li> Data Transparency: Each data point within the database has links from its origin through to its transformations.
All this information is available in a persistent, i.e. as a data object in the database, accessable object.
<li>Revisions and Updates: No data is lost in the update or revision process. The history of the data can be
followed throughout its evolution.
<li>Availability: All persistent data is stored in the database and is accessible to the extent 
that the data provider wishes. This can be proprietory to a consortium, but it can also mean that
the data, and all its links to its origins, is readily available publically.
</li>
