				JThermodynamics  (originally a JAVA implementation of THERGAS, formally called JTHERGAS) estimates temperature dependent thermodynamic information from two dimensional graphical representations of molecules and radicals based on the Benson additivity method. The main use of this method is within automatic combustion mechanism generation systems where fast estimation of a large number and variety of chemical species is needed.
