Each contribution to the temperature dependent thermodyanmic calculation is represented 
by an object in the fundamental data. 
The data structures making up the fundamental data is what makes JThermodynamics unique.
The data is represented in such a way that new fundamental data contributions 
can be added to the thermodynamic calculation by additions of objects to the database.
<p>
The fundamental data, for the most part, consists of 
a 2D-graphical substructure and its contribution to the thermodynamics. To identify a contribution,
the substructure is matched within the radical or species being analysed. If there is a match
then the corresponding contribution is added to the total thermodynamics of the species.
<p> 
The flexibility and adaptability of the calculation to include new structural groups is 
owing to the fact that the structures are represented as 2D-graphical structures which can be 
stored in the database along with how they contribute to the thermodynamics.
<p>
Within Jthermodynamics, there are 6 collections of fundamental data. The type of data determines 
how the correspondig information contributes to the total thermodynamics:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>ThermodynamicBensonRuleDefinition</b> The structure is the classic <i>Benson Rule</i> with a 
    center atom and its connection with its immediate neighboring atoms. These neighboring atoms 
    can be single atoms or functional groups.
    <li> <b>JThermodynamics2DSubstructureThermodynamics</b>
    <li> <b>JThermodynamicsSymmetryStructureDefinition</b> These are the structures and contributions describing 
    the <i>internal</i>, <i>external</i> and <i>optical</i>.
    <li> <b>JThermodynamicsVibrationalStructure</b>
    <li> <b>JThermodynamicsDisassociationEnergyOfStructure</b>
    <li> <b>JThermodynamicsMetaAtomDefinition</b> These are definitions of functional groups which are treated as a single entity or atom. Meta 
    atoms can be benson rule structures, function groups, such as <i>co</i> and <i>co2</i>, used in definition 
    </ul>
