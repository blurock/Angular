The fundamental data sets used for the thermodynamic calculations are not static. For example, new 
information taking into account new chemical structures and functional groups translates to a new set 
of fundamental data that should used for calculations of species having those features.
The dataset for a given type of fundamental data is specified by two labels:
<ul>
<li> <b>DataSetName</b> This is a unique name that signifies a coherent set of fundamental data of that type. The name could 
reflect the source, or its role within the thermodynamic calculation.
<li> <b>DatasetVersion</b> The dataset version is used to signify if a significant modification of the dataset with a given name is
made, then a totally new version is given. The version label is purely of the user's choice. It could be a number given its history and 
importance, such as <i>1.0.3</i> or any other combination of letters and numbers.
</ul>
These two labels are used by the dataset collection to specify which fundamental data of that type should be used.
