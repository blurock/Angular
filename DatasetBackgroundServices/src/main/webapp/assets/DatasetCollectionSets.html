JThermodynamics is designed under the priniciple that data is not static and is continually being updated, either through the addition of 
new data or by the improvement of existing data through <i>improved</i> analysis techniques. In addition, 
JThermodynamics is designed to ensure that when a computation is done it is clear which data is being used. In addition, when two 
sets of fundamental data are to be compared, the exact definition of which data is used for each within the comparison in ensures.
<p>
Dataset colllection sets form the heart of the thermodynamic calculations in defining which datasets of fundamental data are being used.
Specifically, the collection sets specify which sets and their versions of the fundamental data should
be used for the calculation. This specification is given for each one of the different types of fundamental data.
<p>
For each type of fundamental data, the dataset collection specifies two labels, the <b>DatsetName</b>, specifying a group of fundamental data, for the most from a common source or at least on equal ground,
and the <b>DatasetVersion</b> reflecting a version or updates to the dataset specified by the dataset name.
<p>
When a thermodynamic calculation is to be made, the specific dataset collection to use is chosen. 
Thus, with one label, the user knows which data is being used for the computation.
This dataset collection
can either be one that readily availabel and defined by JThermodynamics, i.e. a 'Standard' database, or it could one
created by the user using the user's own set of fundamental data.
