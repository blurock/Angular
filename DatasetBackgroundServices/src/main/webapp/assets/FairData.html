CHEMCONNECT design philosphy is in line with <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR data practices</a>  which 
provides guidelines for data definition and management for the efficient sharing of scientific data. FAIR is an
acronym which stands for:
<li><b>Findable:</b> CHEMCONNECT views as a network of interconnections
Ontology provides context and metadata for search. 
<i>Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. 
Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.</i>

 
<li><b>Accessible:</b> A cloud-based tool for the management of public, consortium and private data. 
<i>Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.</i>


<li><b>Interoperable:</b> The ontology provides meta-data standardized context and for interconversion. 
<i>The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.</i>


<li><b>Re-usable:</b> Ontology based on domain standards, 
both W3C and chemical domain knowledge.
<i>The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described 
so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.</i>
